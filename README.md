# EE 381 Project: Statistical Analysis of Residential Sale Prices

# Project Overview

This project involves a statistical analysis of residential units' sale prices over a 20-year period using Python. The main objective is to calculate the yearly mean, standard deviation, and the probability of sale prices falling between $200,000 and $300,000. Results will be visualized using bar graphs.

# Dataset

    File Name: Sales_01_20.csv
    Description: Contains data of residential unitsâ€™ sale prices from 2001 to 2020.
    Note: The data provided in the dataset is not sorted.

# Calculations

    Yearly Mean: Average sale price for each year.
    Standard Deviation (STD): Measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of sale prices each year.
    Probability: Yearly probability of sale prices ranging from $200,000 to $300,000, calculated as the number of sales within this range divided by the total number of sales that year.

# Visualizations

- Two bar graphs will be generated:

        1. Yearly Mean Sale Prices
        2. Yearly Standard Deviation of Sale Prices
        3. Probability of Sale Prices within the specified range
